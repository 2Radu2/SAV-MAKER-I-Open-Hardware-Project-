# SAV-MAKER-I-Open-Hardware-Project-
SAV MAKER I is an open hardware project I assembled during the Telecom Engineering "Applied Electronics" course at UMA. Based on the vinciDuino board (Arduino Leonardo compatible), it taught hands-on skills in embedded systems and electronics. Fully functional, it's a cost-effective tool for learning and collaboration.
