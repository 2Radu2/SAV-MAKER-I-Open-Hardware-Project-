# SAV-MAKER-I-Open-Hardware-Project-
This repository showcases my work on the SAV MAKER I, an "open hardware" project designed for the Telecom Engineering "Applied Electronics" course at the University of Malaga (UMA). While the project was not originally invented by me, I built and fully assembled a functioning board from a bare PCB and components provided as part of the course.

About the SAV MAKER I:
Compatibility: Based on the vinciDuino board, a predecessor of Arduino's Leonardo, and fully compatible with it.
Purpose: Designed as a learning tool for students to build, analyze, and contribute to the board's evolution over time.
Key Features:
Open hardware design.
8-bit microcontroller, fully compatible with the Atmel environment and Arduino IDE.
Cost-effective and optimized for educational purposes.
My Contribution:
Assembled the board from scratch, soldering all components and ensuring full functionality.
Utilized it for course projects, gaining hands-on experience in embedded systems, electronics, and Arduino programming.
